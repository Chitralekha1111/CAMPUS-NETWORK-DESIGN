# CAMPUS-NETWORK-DESIGN
This is a hierarchical project which mainly consists of three layers. I configured the layers using different protocols such as DHCP,EIGRP,HSRP &amp; NAT.
Ø Local area network (LAN) is a network that is controlled by single authority. 

Ø Campus network (CN) is set of virtual local area networks (VLAN), which are virtual
divided for increasing the performance of network and increases campus network
management with security. 

Ø It provide difference service such as connect user to internet, data sharing among
user, accessing different web service for different functionalities. 

Ø As Campus Network (CN) provides students, teachers, and different university
member for different application, to sustain different activities in the
university, so it need to design in advance. 

Ø To sophisticate the campus network service, this paper proposed Smart Campus
Network Design(SCND) by integrating internet of thing device with classically
network device in campus network and each smart device for different
application must be registered to IOE server and controlled by legitimate user.

Ø To design the proposed campus network design, we used cisco packet tracer
simulator software.
